// Since Deque supports both stack and queue operations, it can be used as both. 
// The Deque data structure supports clockwise and anticlockwise rotations in O(1) time which can be useful in certain applications.

// Also, the problems where elements need to be removed and or added both ends can be efficiently solved using Deque. 
// For example see
//  Maximum of all subarrays of size k problem.,
//  0-1 BFS and 
//  Find the first circular tour that visits all petrol pumps.



// See wiki page for another example of A-Steal job scheduling algorithm where Deque is used as deletions operation is required at both ends.
